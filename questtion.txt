To reinforce the understanding of pointers and dynamic memory allocation in the context of a two-dimensional array representing student grades, implement the following task.

Task Description: Implement a program that manages the grades of multiple students in different courses using a dynamic two-dimensional array.

Requirements:

Prompt the user for the number of students and the number of courses.
Dynamically allocate memory for a two-dimensional array to store the grades.
Allow the user to enter grades for each student and each course.
Implement functions to:
Calculate the highest grade in each course.
Calculate the average grade per course.
Calculate the average grade per student.
Count the number of students with a grade above the average per course.
Display the matrix of grades.
Free the memory before exiting the program.
Implementation Guidelines:

Use pointers to access elements of the two-dimensional array.
Create separate functions for different tasks (e.g., input, calculations, display).
Ensure proper error handling in case of memory allocation failure.
